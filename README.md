# 2425-ETH-SysSec-Exam-Anki

## Introduction

This repo holds Anki decks for the exam of the SySec course of the 2024-2025 academic year of ETH.

There are different types of decks: 
- Normal lectures (`lec<nr>_<summary>`)
- Exercises (`ex<nr>_<summary>`)

This is inspired by NetSec's version: some days ago, I started the exact same repo for the Network Security exam.

## Contribute, Anki's format, Guides, etc.

Check [2425-ETH-NetSec-Exam-Anki](https://github.com/PedroChaps/2024-ETH-NetSec-Exam-Anki?tab=readme-ov-file#contribute)'s README, as it details everything and would be bad practice to just bluntly copy+paste it here.
